                                <p class="infoText">The original type of sushi was first developed in Southeast Asia and spread to south China
                                    before being introduced to Japan sometime around the 8th century.[1][2] Fish was salted
                                    and wrapped in fermented rice, a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Narezushi was
                                    made of this gutted fish which was stored in fermented rice for months at a time for
                                    preservation. The fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling.[3] The fermented
                                    rice was discarded and fish was the only part consumed. This early type of sushi became
                                    an important source of protein for the Japanese. The Japanese preferred to eat fish with
                                    rice, known as namanare or namanari (生成, なまなれ, なまなり, semi-fermented). During the Muromachi
                                    period namanare was the most popular type of sushi. Namanare was partly raw fish wrapped
                                    in rice, consumed fresh, before it changed flavor. This new way of consuming fish was
                                    no longer a form of preservation but rather a new dish in Japanese cuisine. During the
                                    Edo period, a third type of sushi was introduced, haya-zushi (早寿司, 早ずし, fast sushi).
                                    Haya-zushi was assembled so that both rice and fish could be consumed at the same time,
                                    and the dish became unique to Japanese culture. It was the first time that rice was not
                                    being used for fermentation. Rice was now mixed with vinegar, with fish, vegetables and
                                    dried food stuff added. This type of sushi is still very popular today. Each region utilizes
                                    local flavors to produce a variety of sushi that has been passed down for many generations.
                                    When Tokyo was still known as Edo in the early 19th century, mobile food stalls run by
                                    street vendors became popular. During this period nigiri sushi (握り寿司) was introduced,
                                    consisting of an oblong mound of rice with a slice of fish draped over it. After the
                                    Great Kanto earthquake in 1923, nigiri sushi chefs were displaced from Edo throughout
                                    Japan, popularizing the dish throughout the country. Today the sushi dish internationally
                                    known as "sushi" (nigiri zushi; Kantō variety) is a fast food invented by Hanaya Yohei
                                    (華屋与兵衛; 1799–1858) in today's Tokyo (Edo). People in Tokyo were living in haste even
                                    a hundred years ago. The nigiri zushi invented by Hanaya was not fermented and could
                                    be eaten using the fingers or chopsticks. It was an early form of fast food that could
                                    be eaten in public or in the theater.

                                <h4 id="item-2">Sushi in Japan</h4>
                                <p class="infoText">The earliest reference to sushi in Japan appeared in 718 in the Yōrō Code (養老律令 Yōrō-ritsuryō).
                                    As an example of tax paid by actual items, it is written down as "雑鮨五斗 (about 64 liters
                                    of zakonosushi or zatsunosushi?)". However, there is no way to know what this "sushi"
                                    was or even how it was pronounced. By the 9th and 10th century "鮨" and "鮓" are read as
                                    "sushi". This "sushi" was similar to today's Narezushi. For almost the next 800 years,
                                    until the early 19th century, sushi slowly changed and the Japanese cuisine changed as
                                    well. The Japanese started eating three meals a day, rice was boiled instead of steamed,
                                    and of large importance, was the development of rice vinegar.[4] While sushi continued
                                    to be produced by fermentation of fish with rice, the addition of rice vinegar greatly
                                    reduced the time of fermentation[5] and the rice used began to be eaten along with the
                                    fish. In the Muromachi Period (1336 to 1573), the process of producing Oshizushi was
                                    gradually developed where in the fermentation process was abandoned and vinegar was used.
                                    In the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1573–1603), namanare was invented. A 1603 Japanese-Portuguese
                                    dictionary has an entry for namanrina sushi, literally half-made sushi. The namanare
                                    was fermented for a shorter period than the narezushi and possibly marinated with rice
                                    vinegar. It still had the distinctive smell of narezushi. The smell of narezushi was
                                    likely one of the reasons for shortening and eventually skipping the fermentation process.
                                    It is commonly described as "a cross between blue cheese, fish, and rice vinegar".[5]
                                    A story from Konjaku Monogatarishū written in early 12th century makes it clear that
                                    it was not an attractive smell, even if it tasted good: In the early 18th century, oshizushi
                                    was perfected in Osaka and it came to Edo by the middle of 18th century. These sushi
                                    were sold to customers, but because they still required a little fermentation time, stores
                                    hung a notice and posters to customers on when to come for a sushi. Sushi was also sold
                                    near a park during a hanami period and a theater as a type of Bento. Inarizushi was sold
                                    along oshizushi. Makizushi and Chirashizushi also became popular in Edo period. There
                                    were three famous sushi restaurants in Edo, Matsunozushi (松之鮨), Yoheizushi (興兵衛鮓), and
                                    Kenukizushi (けぬき寿し) but there were thousands more sushi restaurants. They were established
                                    in a span of barely twenty years at the start of the 19th century. Nigirizushi was an
                                    instant hit and it spread through Edo like wildfire. In the book Morisadamanko (守貞謾稿)
                                    published in 1852, the author writes that for a cho (100 meters by 100 meters or 10,000
                                    square meters) section of Edo there were one or two sushi restaurants, but that only
                                    one soba restaurant could be found in 1 or 2 cho. This means that there were nearly 2
                                    sushi restaurants for every soba restaurant. These early nigirizushi were not identical
                                    to today's varieties. Fish meat was marinated in soy sauce or vinegar or heavily salted
                                    so there was no need to dip into soy sauce. Some fish was cooked before it was put onto
                                    a sushi. This was partly out of necessity as there were no refrigerators. Each piece
                                    was also larger, almost the size of two pieces of today's sushi. The advent of modern
                                    refrigeration allowed sushi made of raw fish to reach more consumers than ever before.
                                    The late 20th century saw sushi gaining in popularity all over the world.</p>
                                <h5 id="item-2-1">Funazushi</h5>
                                <p class="infoText">Funazushi is a rare type of narezushi still prepared near Lake Biwa, Shiga Prefecture.[6]
                                    Eighteen generations of the Kitamura family have been preparing the dish at Kitashina
                                    since 1619.[7] Fresh funa are scaled and gutted through their gills keeping the body
                                    (and always the roe) of the fish intact. The fish are then packed with salt and aged
                                    for a year before being repacked annually in rice for up to four years. The resulting
                                    fermented dish may be served sliced thin or used as an ingredient in other dishes.[8]
                                    Authentic funazushi is made from a wild subspecies of goldfish called nigorobuna (Carassius
                                    auratus grandoculis) endemic to the lake. It is actually technically misleading to say
                                    that "crucian carp" is used, as though any old funa type carp in the genus may be randomly
                                    used (or the European species may be used), especially since the true crucian carp is
                                    a distinct species altogether, C. carassius, and is not indigenous to Lake Biwa.[9] However,
                                    due to reduced catch of nigorobuna in recent years, it is true that, by necessity, certain
                                    other native species are starting to be substituted.</p>
                                <h5 id="item-2-2">Makizushi</h5>
                                <p class="infoText">After the invention of the sheet form of nori seaweed around 1750, makizushi or norimaki,
                                    rice and various ingredients rolled with nori appeared.[10][11] The term makizushi was
                                    first used in a book Ryōri Sankaikyō (料理山海郷, 1749). However this dish is not current
                                    day makizushi but seafood rolled with bamboo mat (makisu). [12][13][14] Current day makizushi
                                    first appeared in a book Shinsen Kondate buruishū (新撰献立部類集, 1776) which describes makizushi
                                    as "Place a sheet of asakusa-nori, pufferfish or paper on the makisu and spread the cooked
                                    rice then arrange fishes on it. Roll the makisu tightly from one side ..."[12][13][15][16]
                                    In 1778, a food shop guide book Shichijyūgonichi (七十五日, 1778) listed a shop whose famous
                                    menu is "norimaki-zushi".[15] A later book Meihan Burui (名飯部類, 1802) describes makizushi
                                    as "Spread asakusa-nori on the board, place the sushi rice on it. Ingredients are sea
                                    bream, abalone, shiitake, mitsuba and shiso. Roll them firmly...."[17][11][13]</p>
